                <p>THE BENEFITS OF COFFEE SHOP STUDYING
                    The biggest benefit of studying in a coffee shop should be obvious: proximity to caffeine. While not everyone is a coffee junkie, coffee shops offer an array of caffeinated beverages to help you stay awake and focused. One scientific study found that 200 milligrams of coff<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">ee (about the amount in a large coffee at any coffee shop) improves problem-solving skills and memory. It also helps the brain identify certain phrases or words faster. If you’re not a coffee nut, there are also teas and other non-coffee drinks, as well as healthy snacks, to keep you focused on your work rather than your rumbling tummy and sleepy eyes.
                    
                    The environment in a coffee shop is also a big benefit—usually. Ambient sound can be great to help you concentrate, and some studies have even shown that environments like this can help boost your creativity! So many people go to coffee shops to work and study, and the environment is most likely to encourage you to stay focused on your tasks since everyone else is doing exactly that. There is also some camaraderie amongst those who study at coffee shops regularly. You can encourage other people to keep pressing forward, and they may encourage you to stay focused and complete your assignments.
                    
                    Another big benefit of studying at a coffee shop is fewer distractions. Yes, there are people coming in and out the door and talking around you, but your home and normal surroundings aren’t there to distract you. You don’t need to go throw a load of laundry in or let the dog out, and you don’t need to clean up the kitchen table or climb in your bed to take a nap. When you’re at a coffee shop, it’s just you, your computer, your books, and a cup of caffeine.
                    
                    If you’ve been studying a ton or if you’ve been working on a particular paper or assignment for days, it can be really refreshing and beneficial to change your atmosphere. If you’ve been at home in your room or working in the library, sometimes getting out into the world can do wonders for your mind and your productivity. If you haven’t socialized in a few days, a coffee shop may be a welcome treat for you to have some human interaction as well.
                    
                    Coffee shops are also a great place for a study group to meet. You’re not going to get shushed like you would in a library, but you can all get your liquid focus and charge forward in conquering the topic at hand. There is also the added benefit of not wanting to waste a trip. It would be so frustrating to set aside an afternoon to study at a coffee shop, only to get there and mess around on social media and not accomplish anything. If you’re going to make the trip out, you’re more likely to stay on task and be productive through the duration of your time there.
                    
                    No matter what type of assignment you’re completing, and whether you’re working in a group or individually, a coffee shop can seriously boost your creativity and your focus, helping you accomplish a great deal of work and studying in less time.</span>
